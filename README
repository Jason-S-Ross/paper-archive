About this Project
------------------

This project provides tools to encode files as tiled QR codes and to recreate
the files from the QR codes. This allows important digital documents like
private keys to be archived on paper.

Usage
-----

Call `generate-page $file $output` to create a single PNG image made of tiled QR
codes that represent `$file`. Call `read-page $img1 $img2 $img3` to read from a
series of images that contain the contents of one or more files.

Method of Operation
-------------------

Files are broken up into chunks to be QR encoded. Each chunk has a header
specifying the name of the file, its sha256 checksum, the number of the chunk,
and the total number of chunks.

The png image associated with each file has its name and sha256 checksum
watermarked in plain text.

In order to recreate a file, the final product's checksum must match the
original.

Contents are base64 encoded in the QR code.

TODO Handle multiple pages of QR tiles

Requirements
------------

This depends on ZBar Barcode Reader and Libqrencode.
